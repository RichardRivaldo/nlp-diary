The current implementation only has approximately 13k data, which then is splitted into 11k training data and 1.3k validation and test data each. This number is still quite small considering that there are just massive number of variations in either the Indonesian or English sentences. Providing more data will surely improve the performance of the model, especially data related to emotions (related to the NLP pipeline). "

On the other hand, increasing the embedding dimension might also improve the performance of the model."
